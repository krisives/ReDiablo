Rage by JG:

1.For 12 seconds it adds: 2·clvl to Strength and Vitality and 1.5·clvl to Dexterity.

2.For 12 more seconds, during a lethargy phase, it decreases Strength, Dexterity and Vitality by the same amount (counted from normal values).

3.Afterwards you lose 2·Vit life. There is a bug however so if you click on any item in your inventory your life is restored.
