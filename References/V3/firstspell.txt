"Anyway, I hope at least one of these can be answered."

Ok, I'll pick this one:

"No.5: Is there any way to change the skills but also change the skill icon and title? It always appears as "NULL"..."

Here is where the first slot in the book is set to the player's skill. Note that this only changes the book, not the character's skill. That needs to be changed seperatly....

:00404873 C705104D48001A000000
mov dword ptr [00484D10], 0000001A

:00404883 C705104D48001C000000
mov dword ptr [00484D10], 0000001C

:00404893 C705104D48001B000000
mov dword ptr [00484D10], 0000001B

Simply change the '1A', '1C', and '1B' to be what you want.

P.S. If you haven't already done so, you can make the monster's hit points a dword instead of a byte (this will allow you to exceed 255 hit points). Also, this change will cause Diablo's hit points to be calculated from his base monster data instead of being set by the code.
