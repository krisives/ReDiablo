Gold drop bonuses
by Charlie
Gold drops are directly related to the dungeon level, as you probably already know. 

Dlv * 5 with a small increase to top it off. That increase is slightly larger than the current dungeon level as well. Nightmare has a +16 DLvl bonus before the multiplication, and Hell has +32. It's easiest to change these bonuses than it is to change the actual formula.

208C8 10 <---- Nightmare DLvl bonus
208F6 20 <---- Hell DLvl bonus
