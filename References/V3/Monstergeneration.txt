This is all Diablo. The order and layout of the code in this area is more or less identical to the one in
Hellfire.

Adding monsters is actually not a small litle routine, it is a
very large and complex shunk of code. Also, set areas are special in 
that the monsters (at least some) are added in with the actual dungeon layout 
code. It really get a bit messy for such set piece stuff and quest related 
things, and this also includes level 16 (except for the extra random monsters).
Adding monsters in general is done starting at 4335b3. This is however NOT where the
game pick possible monster types on a level, this is done much earlier 
in the dungeon generation routine and for random picking it is done at 43200d. 
You will note that the game specifically check for level 16 here and for that 
level add Advocates, Blood Knights and Diablo. Monster types CAN get added to the 
list here by a few other parts of the code, especially ones related to quests 
and such. I have no idea if the game requires those 3 types to be picked 
here for level 16 to be able to generate correctly, or if they will be added 
anyway in some way later on and so on. You may want to experiement though.
