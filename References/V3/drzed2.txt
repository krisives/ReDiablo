I was wondering before why these bows were so popular, but now I know : the price of 5000 gold made the arrows very cheap. IMO you should set appropriate prices for all unique bows (and increase price on Knockback for bows, remember?). BTW a buying price of 17000 gold for 'Stone Bow' is not that much: a (plain) bow of Swiftness is 16000 gold.

Perhaps you should give the Warrior this half cost also?

IMO you should NOT decrease repair cost of all items, only for bows. This should be easy by changing the formula you are now using for arrow costs. High level warriors, especially those with a item 'of the Blood', don't need much gold for potions, books or item buying. Only by letting them repair expensive items, you can control the amount of gold they need.

When increasing gold drops, I think you want to be sure that deeper levels/difficulties do not benefit too much. Apart from that, I like the idea of 'reducing inflation', although I'm afraid it will not have as much impact on the game as you would like. IMO just lowering arrow cost by changing your formula for Griz' prices, and halving (or more!) the mana cost of the Fletchery (and increasing the max of 100 arrows) would be enough to solve most, if not all, of the problems.

Must be Hailstorm! Since I haven't found Knuckle Duster and Diana's Grace yet, I would very much like to have it, although I vaguely remember there was some nasty drawback with that bow. 

About this other version of 2.1.1, I assume the difference is in the prices for some unique bows. We would like to receive the newer version, especially if other unique bows (like Hailstorm?) are also 'fixed'.
