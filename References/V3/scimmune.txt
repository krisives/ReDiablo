Here's a hack i made that checks the resistance values in the static table. If the value is 40 or above, the monster will be stone curse immune. I doubt this will affect the unique monsters. If you take the lazy way out and use a mod making program, you must go back and reassign the +40 hex modifier each time you edit a monster, since my program uses the low value.

2C582 change F0E6 to 00E7
2C586 change 1B74 to 407D

ps..this also disables Diablo's attack type from being stone curse immune, so you must give him the +40 resistance modifier for him to be immune.

Well, finally got around to doing it......just had to wait for Zakarun to speak up and ask for it..hehehe.

32E9A change 20 to 54
32E9E change 1B74 to 407D (or 807D)

The 40 can be changed to 80 in case you use a hex editor.
