Slain Hero Fix (SP only)

The disabling of incorrect character speech led to another crash.

Fix:

File Offset 000506BE

:004512BE FF74083C                push [eax+ecx+3C]
:004512C2 8B540838                mov edx, dword ptr [eax+ecx+38]
wordt
:004512BE E9CB000000              jmp 0045138E
:004512C3 909090                  3*nop

This finally leads to a stable 'Slain Hero'.
