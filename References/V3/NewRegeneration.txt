New Regeneration


During testing it showed that the lowest Demons (Normal mode Goatmen) take less then 10 seconds to fully regenerate. This is even faster then a Teleporting Boss in D2! Also Diablo and his Ghost are NOT doable with missiles (arrows or spells), even in Nitemare mode.

Regeneration gets halved, and maximum lowered (for Dark Ghost). To compensate, monsters get more Hp.
