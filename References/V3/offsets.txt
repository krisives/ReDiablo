When programs are loaded in memory each section is assigned a different virtual (memory) addres. These addresses do not have to correspond to the raw address (in the .exe).

Dhack uses virtual addresses for editing. It's easy to convert from a virtual address to a raw address, for Diablo v1.07 you must subtract the following from the virtual address for each section:

Name Desc. Start End Difference
.text (code) 0x00400 0x78A00 0x400C00
.rdata (read only data) 0x78A00 0x8E100 0x401600
.data (r/w data) 0x8E100 0xB9A00 0x402200
.rsrc (resources) 0xB6A00 0xB9AAA 0x5F8600
