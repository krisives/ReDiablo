about Manashield damage reduction

Try altering (0002EEE2) which should be FD.

FD is -3. What it does is take the damage, divide by -3 and then add the result to the damage.

Therefore damage = damage + (damage/-3)
... which is ...
damage = damage - (damage/3)

But, if you make the number any positive number, the damage will be

damage = damage + (damage/#)

So making it 03 will increase damage by 1/3.
Making it 05 will increase damage by 1/5.
etc.
