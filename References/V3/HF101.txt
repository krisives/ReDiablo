 

• Fixed Gossip (same gossip from each towner every time)

• Fixed disappearing quests (upon re-entering the town level, quest statuses were incorrectly cleared through array bounds overstep).

• Fixed generating spell books by Adria (would "morph" on new game).

• Fixed the bug where picking up gold when your inventory is full duplicates the gold in your hand and fills your gold slot.

• Fixed the Berserk spell to prevent crashes (large numbers of berserk monsters occasionally attacked dead monsters).

• Fixed inactive monsters to prevent same kind of crash as above.

• Fixed entering levels; had crashed on some systems (seemingly randomly).

• Fixed doppelganger's items to not clone Diablo.

• Fixed generating rings of fire behind a wall.

• Sped up monk's open-hand attack (users complained he should be faster with feet than with the sweeping staff).

• Various small internal fixes to prevent potential misbehavior.

• Fixed monster hitpoint variable type for tough monsters (some monsters, especially in Nightmare/Hell difficulty, had way fewer hit points than specified).

• Changed Search spell to show items on automap, too (users complained they couldn't find things behind solid walls in Caves, Nest, Crypt).

• Fix to unique items changing between games (veil of steel, arkaine's valor, etc).

• Fixed to dropping and picking back up oiled items (bonus was lost).

• Fixed Cathedral Map activation crash bug

• Added sounds to Mana Drain and Disenchant traps.

• Monster hit points in Nightmare/Hell are +100/200 instead of +1.5/+3.

• Fixed monster stats display in Nightmare/Hell to reflect the halving.

• Balance/Stability/Harmony now does something
