not just town, this does everywhere
by Vector- 
don't know exactly what this does, though my guess would be that it alters the frame speed of the walk animations...?

4E5CD 86 > B8 	at 44F1CD
4E748 86 > B8	at 44F348
4E89B 86 > B8	at 44F49B
4F825 86 > B8	at 450425

that will make the characters walk at high speeds, you could probably get the characters walking not quite so fast by setting it to somewhere between 86 and B8, but I haven't the slightest clue what result that will have, nor how efficient/non-crashing this code, as I got it from an old hack.....

Well, I don't doubt its working, but you can't just change the number to alter the speed.<br>
<br>
The original instruction is:<br>
<br>
cmp dword ptr [esi+00687968], eax<br>
<br>
Here eax is fetched from right before the starting stats for characters and hapens to be 8 for all character classes. In town it is hard coded to 8 though (end result, always 8 :)<br>
<br>
687968 is used as a frame counter. Only Casting spells uses that for frame counting, for other actions another system is used (hmm, I wonder if that may be a reason for the haste bug, will have to check).<br>
<br>
IN Hellfire, the fast walk is done by every others frame (odd frame) increase the 687928 and also the normal frame counter (as I said, I have not looked much at it, but would guess one is a frame counter and one is a sort of distance walked counter).<br>
<br>
What is strange though, is that change you propose would change the instruction to:<br>
<br>
cmp dword ptr [eax+00687968], edi<br>
<br>
Which hardly makes sense. Did I miss somethng?<br>
<br>
Ohh, by the way, the last change is for death, not walk as far as I can see.<P>
