First, this should be the fix for bows:

6800 84C8 740E FF86 0478 6800 EBDD 001E
100C 1018 xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx

I say should because I have a tendency to move other code out of my way and I can't recall if this is writing over code that you need. I think it is safe. But, as always, backup first.

The code goes about doing the speeds in a slightly different way. One thing that I noticed about the melee weapon speeds is that multiple weapon speeds are not very compatable due to the code. For example, in my mod I have a spell that hastes the caster for a short period of time. However, if that person is using a an item with a quick attack, quick combined with haste will become a 'faster attack'. Anyway, that's more trivia than anything. The bow speed code that I wrote doesn't have that flaw, and is smaller (to fix in the avaiable space), but it probably consumes a few extra cycles (the reason why the original code was done the long way). A few extra cycles here and there are not that important (and will not be noticed).
