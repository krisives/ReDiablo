Tricky
by Jarulf 


It may be a bit tricy to acomplish that. First of, the flag is set in the routine that check for among other things hit recovery. that is, if you are not allowed for a hit recovery, you can not get the flag set. If I remember correctly, you can't get hit recovery on a monster that is resistant. So you would have to change quite a few things. The flag is kept on each monster at 64e717 where the first 4 bits flag for each player (the flag is of course also always set in the monster death routine).

The place where this is set, starts at 43474f (the test right before is to see if it was a playr or monster that hit the target).

For players hitting monsters with spells, it is called from42ab83 and 42abb3, and possibly a few other places, did not check the others. But changing them might have other consequences.

So, if anyone have time and patience to invest in a good solution, you may get an easy answer, unfortunately I can't give it. Perhaps with the help above someone else can help you.
