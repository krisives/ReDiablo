This package contains what I still remember, and what I dug up, about CEL files.

Appearantly, I still have a LOT of stuff on my disk that I thought I had lost ages ago,
all diablo modmaking related.

Anyways... the best attempt I made at Cel files was as late as last december (that is half
a year ago). I should've written a complete spec of what I knew then, I know. But it seems
I didn't. I'm left with two programs on my disk named something cel, however they're work in
progress. And one is just something I used to see what's in those images... i think... anyways
I'll not do anything about the code until someone asks me about it. However I included both
these programs, along with the sources (standard C). They're celdump and celconv. Remember that
they are incomplete. However, screen00.pcx shows one of those wide cels that I converted, in
action (okay, I know I'm not an artist).

I just tested celconv and celdump... celdump dumps teh shit on you, and don't look for
celconv.txt... it doesn't exist.

I know there have been several attempts to do a cel converter... I never received anyone elses
though... and I never saw any in-game shots... anyways... these are just the half completed stuff
as those are.

Ok, back to the cel format eh...

Except for looking at my sources, also try and find Telamon's (author of CV) cvcel.dll source.
They're on his site (or were 6 months ago...). It gave me precious hints anyways. Other than that...
well, if there's enough interest (that is, one person) I'll (try to) give better info. I alos attached
some documents I found on my disk concerning CELs, and also CL2s. Though some of the ought to be in
darkmodnotes.zip.

Laters,
Maranar, Gallant, Joel Molin  (all me, hey =)

Edit: I added cvcel_src.zip, this is Telamons CEL loader
Edit: I found one half of a file format spec... just appended a comment at the end of it..
