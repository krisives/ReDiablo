Improved monster resistances

Spell damage will be 1/8, instead of 1/6, against resisting monsters:

file offset 0003C83E

:0043D43E 6A06                    push 00000006
changed into
:0043D43E 6A08                    push 00000008

(This is a quickfix, and should be replaced with better code later)
