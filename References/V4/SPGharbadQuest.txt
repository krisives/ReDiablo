In SP, the activation of the Gharbad Quest causes Diablo to receive Gharbad's name, and Gharbad himself never appears. This is caused by the fact that Diablo is a boss without a corresponding data-record and game apparantly uses data from boss number 0 if it is 'active'.

The fix is to free boss number 0 from use by a quest, so Gharbad's Quest gets disabled. Additional changes are made to preserve the speeches related to Gharbad's name and to prevent those speeches from being activated at Diablo's death.
