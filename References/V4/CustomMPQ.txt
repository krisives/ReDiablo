Hi:

Here's your MPQ file.  The Directory for the Objcurs2.CEL replacement is
Data\Inv\HF_Beta.CEL
(for your MPQ viewer data file)

1) Rewrite "Objcurs2.CEL" at 93C31 & change to "HF_Beta.CEL"

Now the MPQ...

"The Dark"

2) rewite the files at 9F4AD changing it to "The Dark.MPQ" this will
also write over another file name (for the bard) It 'don't' matter ->
it's what I did in Doomfire.

3) Place the MPQ into your Hellfire file folder.

If you have any problems implementing the please let me know.

I'm going to assume that you have a copy of "The Dark" somewhere with
the changes you told me to make.  I assume this since you told me that
the game worked with the changes you made.  If you DON'T let me know.
I'm willing to do this for you.

Well, the edited CEL file I made doesn't work (YET!) it's great in the
cel viewer BUT for some reason I cannot get the game program to work.
It loads fine, however once you bring up the inventory screen with the
new items the game crashes - S**T!  It hasn't affected any other stuff
though, the other graphics in my hacked CEL work fine.  Also I was
thinking that the numerical CEL values (E3, E4) used may be prohibited
by code however the replacement for the bovine plate (at E2) won't work
either.  This leaves me with the CEL file as the problem.  I figure
there may be some header info that needs to be changed.  Oh well... once
I figure the problem out I'll send you a new MPQ.

Happy mod making

Ted
