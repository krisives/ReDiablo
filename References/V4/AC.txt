Useful AC for Melee in The Dark



Max. Base To Hit for normal monster: 135

Horned Deaths, Bone Lords, Fallen Angels, *all* Knights, Diablo and The Dark Ghost have this highest ToHit value.

Normal : 135
Night  : 135 +  85 = 220
Hell   : 135 + 120 = 255

Max.MLvL = 32 (many, but not all of the normal monsters mentioned above)



AutoHit for monsters is the highest of [8 + 8*Diff + DLvL/2] and [DLvL]

	Caves(12)	Hell(16)	Nest(4)		Abyss(4)

Normal	14		16		20		24
Night	22		24		26		28
Hell	30		32		34		36



Melee To Hit = 40 + BaseToHit + 9*(MLvl-CLvl) - AC,
so Useful AC = 40 + BaseToHit + 9*(32+Bonus-CLvL) - AutoHit

Maximum useful AC for normal monsters on Abyss(4):

Clvl		Nightmare	Hellmode

30		385		547
35		340		502
40		295		457
45     		250		412
50		205		367

For Hell(16) all values are 4 lower. To find the AC in other situations, add or subtract 9 for every difference in MLvl or CLvL. For example, a level 42 character fighting level 30 Knights in Hellmode, will need 421 AC for best possible protection.

Only Warriors with a shield can reach the needed AC for Hellmode, although they might have to use some saved oils for that.



Monsters also have a AutoMiss vs. characters

Max.ToHit = 95 - CLvL/4 

Clvl	MaxTH	AutoMiss

30	88	12		
35	87	13		
40	85	15		
45      84	16		
50	83	17
