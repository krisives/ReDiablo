Adding 100% piercing against monsters for Abyss trap

This affects all missiles originating from Traps, and also from other monsters (although this can only be charmed spitters AFAIK). A more precise solution would require many jumps and extra code, with very little better effect.

The following obsolete code is executed for Player-Missile vs Monster (not traps) and can be used to make another spell effect 100% piercing like Bone Spirit is.
