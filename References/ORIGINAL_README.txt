DarkModNotes

These text files are the notes made during the development of The Dark, a mod for Hellfire. 
They are unsorted, and thus contain old and incorrect information from a time when we where still learning and, for example, didn't even know how to calculate a JMP instruction in ASM. There are also untranslated (Dutch) notes in several places. 

Most of the information is about the modifications to Hellfire in The Dark, but you will also find notes from Dr.Zed about his famous DZMod for Diablo (it was these notes that learned us the most about ASM and modmaking), postings from Jarulf and information from Charlie, Selby, Ted Powell, and others.

Feel free to distribute these notes, but not without this ReadMe.
